Problem Description:

You will use the concept of seams to obtain new images.

Project Requirements:
You are supposed to develop the following two software to get the full credit. Each one of the is equally weighted.

    Image Recombination: A software that can seamlessly combine two similar images into one. Your algorithm will find the best seam that can go through both of the images. Using this seam, your program will combine the two images into one such that one side of the final image will come from first image and other side will come from second image.
    Image Retargeting by Seam Carving: A software that can change the size of the image by removing least energy seams. 

Bonus: Any additional use of seams to obtain different effects can give you bonus points up to half of the project credit.

For the required parts of the project, implement your operations only using the basic programming operations such as while or for loops and basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and power. In other words, no high level operation provided by some programming languages is allowed.

Project Submission:

Please write the program in either Processing or Java or C or C++. For C and C++ use OpenGL and GLUTgraphics routines for the display. Upload your program and all essential files to webassign as a "as small as possible" zip directory. In your program, include comments about the program and your name. Also make sure to provide information that and instructions on how to run it.
