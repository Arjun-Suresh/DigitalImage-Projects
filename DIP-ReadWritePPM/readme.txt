Problem Description:

The goal of this project is to refresh your programming skills in C/C++ and OpenGL. This project will also serve as a steppingstone for other projects. The requirements are listed below. You can base your code from a fully functional program called pr01.cpp that displays a yellow image. A makefile can be downloaded here. This project consists of two tasks: (1) Turn a simple text file into an image and (2) Procedurally create an interesting image.

Summary of minimal requirements for creating a simple image:

Your first program should be able to read a file that can be considered a pseudo-PPM image, i.e. it has to have an ASCII header that describe image properties. You pseudo-PPM can be a PPM file. The image data must be an ASCII text file that is written in English that can be readable by anybody. Your program should be able to read as if it were image data and use it to display an image.

In the second program you will create your own image procedurally and display it in your program. You should also be able to write this procedurally created image in your own pseudo-PPM file format. If everything works correctly, the first program should be able to read and display this file.

Your program can create other images and we can give you bonus credit for additional work. Put your resulting images to your website. Do not use any high level operation such as ``read PPM''. For the required parts of the project, implement your operations only using the basic programming operations.

Project Submission:

Please write the program in either Processing or Java or C or C++. For C and C++ use OpenGL and GLUTgraphics routines for the display. Upload your program and all essential files to webassign as a "as small as possible" zip directory. In your program, include comments about the program and your name. Also make sure to provide information that and instructions on how to run it.
