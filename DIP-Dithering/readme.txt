Problem Description:

You will develop a dithering tool that includes Error diffusion and Ordered Dither.

Project Requirements:
You are supposed to implement following methods to get the full credit. Each one of the is equally weighted.

    Floyd-Steinberg Error diffusion
    An Ordered Dither 

Bonus: Any additional work can give you bonus points up to half of the project credit. For instance, you can create an interactive dithering using the camera of your PC.

For the required parts of the project, implement your operations only using the basic programming operations such as while or for loops and basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and power. In other words, no high level operation provided by some programming languages is allowed.

Project Submission:

Please write the program in either Processing or Java or C or C++. For C and C++ use OpenGL and GLUTgraphics routines for the display. Upload your program and all essential files to webassign as a "as small as possible" zip directory. In your program, include comments about the program and your name. Also make sure to provide information that and instructions on how to run it.
